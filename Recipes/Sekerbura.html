<h2>Ingredients:</h2>

<div class="checklist">

<h3>For the filling:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 kg of hazelnut kernels</li>
    <li>1 kg of powdered sugar</li>
    <li>Ground cardamom to taste (1-2 teaspoons)</li>
</ul>
<h3>For the dough:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 kg of flour</li>
    <li>4 eggs</li>
    <li>600 g butter (melted)</li>
    <li>200 g of sour cream</li>
    <li>Half a teaspoon of yeast</li>
    <li>Milk</li>
</ul> 

</div>

<h2>Preparation:</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Usually the filling is prepared in advance. Nuts are roasted a little in the oven and peeled. Then the kernels are ground and powdered sugar and beaten cardamom are added and mixed.</li>
  <li>For the dough, flour, eggs, sour cream, yeast are mixed, oil is added little by little, everything is mixed together, then milk is gradually added and the dough is kneaded. The dough should be neither too soft nor too hard. The dough rests for 1 hour in a warm place. During the preparation of sekerbura, the dough should be kept in a cool place so that it does not ferment and soften.</li>
  <li>The dough is divided into small logs. About 90-100 Sekerbura of normal size are bought from 2 kg of flour kneaded dough and 1 kg of filling.</li>
  <li>Spread the logs about 10 cm in diameter.</li>
  <li>Place about 2 tablespoons of the filling and press the filling slightly inwards to secure and crimp the edges. The edges of the sekerbura should be thinly folded.</li>
  <li>Then the Sekerburas are marked with specilised tweezers.</li>
  <li>After drawing the pattern, the Sekerburas are laid out on a sheet and kept uncovered in a cool place. Sekerbura's face should be slightly dry so that the decorations do not disappear.</li>
  <li>After the sekerburas are ready, they are baked in the oven at 180 degrees. Sekerbura should not be reddened. Six lightly browned Sekerburas are considered cooked.</li>
