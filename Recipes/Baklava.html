<h2>Preparation:</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Let's prepare the dough. Pour the milk into a bowl and warm it up.</li>
  <li>We melt the oil.</li>
  <li>Mix the yeast in warm water and let it foam for 5-10 minutes.</li>
  <li>We add eggs, yeast, milk, oil, sour cream, and salt to the middle of the flour.</li>
  <li>We knead soft dough.</li>
  <li>We put nylon on the dough, put a towel, wrap it in a blanket, leave it to ferment for 2 hours.</li>
  <li>We prepare the filling. After roasting the walnut in a pan and cleaning the shell, we pass it through a nut smoking machine.</li>
  <li>We mix ground walnuts with powdered sugar and cardamom. Melt the butter to grease the tops.</li>
  <li>We prepare the syrup. Add water and powdered sugar to the bowl, boil for 2-3 minutes as soon as it boils and remove.</li>
  <li>Break the egg yolk into a bowl and beat it to apply it on the face.</li>
  <li>We clean the almond kernel for the face.</li>
  <li>The dough is baked for 2 hours.</li>
  <li>We divide the dough into 12 parts for each pan. We cut two large logs and the rest into small logs.</li>
  <li>Spread the top with (a little) flour.</li>
  <li>Grease the pan and spread the dough. We pour oil on top and grease it.</li>
  <li>Spread 1 cup of filling on each layer.</li>
  <li>We spread and grease the top again.</li>
  <li>In this way, we prepare all the layers. After putting the last layer, we make the edges well.</li>
  <li>We cut the dough in the shape of a rhombus.</li>
  <li>We keep it for half an hour. Then we add eggs and almond kernels in the middle.</li>
  <li>Bake in an oven heated to 180 degrees until the face is slightly browned. Then we take it out and oil it.</li>
  <li>We set the degree to 150 degrees. We take out the face until it is completely red and pour the syrup.</li>
  <li>In both cases, we go with the places that are cut with a knife so that both the oil and the syrup spread well.</li>
  <li>After pouring the syrup, keep it in the oven for 3-5 minutes and take it out.</li>
  <li>When the baklava is warm, we take it out of the pan one by one and put it in another flat dish.</li>
</ol>

<div class="left_bit">
<p>Note: If you want the face of the baklava to be shiny and beautiful, then take 3 tsp of the baklava syrup, melt it with 1 tsp of honey and apply it to the face of the ready hot baklava with a brush.</p>

<p>Bon Appetit!</p>
